        Documentation main page for both srsRAN Project and srsRAN 4G. The srsRAN software suites are free and open-source 5G and 4G software radio implementations. They can be used with third-party core network solutions to build complete end-to-end mobile wireless networks for R&D, testing and PoC implementations. All srsRAN software is designed to run in linux with off-the-shelf compute and radio hardware

srsRAN Documentation
====================

The srsRAN software suite is an open-source collection of 4G and 5G software radio implementations from `SRS <https://www.srs.io>`_. Applications are implemented in portable C++ with minimal third-party dependencies. Licensed under AGPLv3, srsRAN apps run on Linux with off-the-shelf compute and radio hardware.

---- 

The **srsRAN Project** is an ORAN-native 5G CU/DU with a complete stack from I/Q to IP. You can find the srsRAN Project documentation `here <https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project/en/latest/>`_.

---- 

The **srsRAN 4G** suite provides an end-to-end 4G network implementation with full-stack applications for UE, eNodeB and EPC. You can find the srsRAN 4G documentation `here <https://docs.srsran.com/projects/4g/en/latest/>`_.
